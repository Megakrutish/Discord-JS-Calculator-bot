# Discord-JS-Calculator-bot
# The code is forked from https://github.com/DJj123dj/calculator-bot/
I made this bot compatible with the newest discord.js version

To run this you need to install node.js and these libraries: discord.js, mathjs

Insert bot's token in the config, invite the bot to your server and type "&calculator". magic!
